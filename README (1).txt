potato: Text Origin Classifier Project
Project Brief
The objective of the "Text Origin Classifier Project" is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing whether a given piece of text is authored by a human or generated by a machine. Our project aims to maximize the accuracy and reliability of the classification model.

Repository Structure
/Code
This directory contains IPython notebooks demonstrating the implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including SVM, LR, RF, and SGD. It has 'Final_Approach' and our 'Alternative_Approaches'.

/Meeting Minutes
Contains detailed documentation of each team meeting, including discussions, decisions made, and future plans. This ensures transparency and continuity throughout the project's lifecycle.

Environment Requirements
Ensure you have the following software installed to run the code from this repository:

Python: Version 3.8 or newer
scikit-learn: Version 1.4.2

Usage
To run the notebooks in the /Code directory:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the /Code directory.
Open the 'Final_Approach' IPython notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.
Ensure all dependencies are installed as specified in the environment requirements.
Execute the code cells sequentially to observe the results.
